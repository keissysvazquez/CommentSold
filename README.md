### API Automation Thought Exercise

Added comments in some of the areas in which I would automate the API, rather than the UI.

### Coding Problem 

```const arr = [2,7,9,0]

var plusOne = function(digits) {
  let i = digits.length;
  let carry = 1;
  let tmp;
  const res = [];
  while(i > 0 || carry) {
    tmp = (--i >= 0 ? digits[i] : 0) + carry;
    carry = tmp / 10 | 0;
    res.unshift(tmp % 10);
  }
  console.log(res)
  return res;
};

plusOne(arr)```
