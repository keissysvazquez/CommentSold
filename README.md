### API Automation Thought Exercise

Added comments in some of the areas in which I would automate the API, rather than the UI.

### Coding Problem 

```
const array = [2,7,9,0]

function incrementArrayNumber(arr){ 
    let carry = 1; 

    for (let i = arr.length - 1; i >= 0; i --){

        arr[i] += carry; 

        if (arr[i] >= 10 ){ 
            carry = 1; 
            arr[i] -= 10;
        }
        else { 
            carry = 0
            break; 
        }
    }
    if carry === 1 { 
        arr.unshift(1);
    }
    return arr; 
}

console.log(incrementArrayNumber(array))

```
